            We possess within us two minds. So far I have written only of the
            conscious mind. I would now like to introduce you to your second
            mind, the hidden and mysterious subconscious. Our subconscious mind
            contains such power and complexity that it literally staggers the
            imagination.And finally the subconscious is the mechanism through
            which thought impulses which are repeated regularly with feeling and
            emotion are quickened, charged. Our subconscious mind contains such
