                We are committed to get you your perfect jacket in the first go.
                However, if your custom order doesn’t fit you well, we do the

              <strong>How we strive to achieve Win-Win Situation?</strong>
              <p>
                Custom (read: bespoke) jackets can be tricky and also keep us on
                our toes to achieve a win-win situation. The need of return can
                occur due to the following reasons.
              </p>
              <strong>Design &amp; Quality</strong>
              <p>
                Solution: Before dispatching your order, we share pictures of
                your actual product with you. You can review the design,
                material and stitching before we dispatch it. So this reason is
                potentially eliminated.
              </p>
              <strong>Sizing</strong>
              <p>
                Solution: When you place your custom order, our CS agent asks
                for your body measurement. Please refer to our sizing guide to
                take your body measurements. When you take your measurements
                correctly, there are chances for sizing error. Still, if the
                jacket reaches you and it doesn’t fit you perfectly, we do the
                first alteration free of cost. However, you would have to pay
                for shipping the jacket back to us.
