                to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when
                discovered. Our website contains a large number of products and

                will normally verify prices as part of our order processing
                procedures so that, where a product's correct price is less than
                our stated price, we will refund the lower amount when
                dispatching the product to you. If a product's correct price is
                higher than the price stated on our website, we will normally,
                at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before
                dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of
                such rejection. We are under no obligation to provide the
                product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we
                have sent you an Order Confirmation or a Shipping Confirmation,

                reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error.
